# SELF a mechanism for referring to parts of the message

# Many choices for how to do this.
# Could do it without special machinery by using the
# standard A-B trick for giving e.g. a Turing machine
# access to its own description.
# Instead, will simply introduce a "primer" function
# that gives access to every statement made so far 
# (question: should future statements be included? 
# tentatively assume YES: will simplify
# discussion of creating modified copies of the
# complete message).

# For now, assume primer is a list of statements,
# with each statement being a list in the same
# form as "translate" functions expect.
# This means that there is, for now, no
# distinction between unary or binary,
# and the "/" structure is expanded.

(intro primer);

# this line is referred to later - change/move carefully
(equal (list-ref (primer) 0) (vector intro is:int));
(equal (list-ref (primer) 1) (vector is:int (vector unary 0)));
(equal (list-ref (primer) 2) (vector is:int (vector unary 1 0)));
(assign idx (list-find (primer) (vector intro primer) (? x 0))
	(equal (list-ref (primer) (+ (idx) 1))
	       (vector equal 
		       (vector list-ref (vector primer) 0)
		       (vector vector intro is:int))));
		       
# Now, we could return to the MUD, simulate an agent A
# transferring a copy of the primer to another agent B,
# and then show B making a modified copy of that primer
# and passing it back to A.

# We could also show agents experimenting with the
# primer in various ways.
